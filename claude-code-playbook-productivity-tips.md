## Tip 2: Implement Time Blocking Technique

**Core Idea**: Organize tasks into specific blocks of time to dedicate focused periods without distractions.

### How to Implement Time Blocking

#### Step 1: Identify Your Tasks
**Action**: List all tasks you need to complete

**Types**:
- Work projects
- Personal errands
- Meetings
- Email/communication
- Deep work

**Our Application**:
```
Daily Tasks:
- Client meetings (known schedule)
- MCP development (deep work)
- Code reviews (collaborative work)
- Email/Slack (communication)
- Documentation (focused work)
```

---

#### Step 2: Estimate Task Duration
**Action**: For each task, estimate realistic completion time

**Why it matters**: Accurate estimates prevent overbooking and stress

**Tips**:
- Add 25% buffer for unexpected issues
- Track actual time to improve future estimates
- Be honest about your capacity

**Example**:
```
MCP development: 2-3 hours (need focus)
Code review: 30-45 minutes
Client meeting: 1 hour (includes prep)
Documentation: 1-2 hours
```

---

#### Step 3: Create Time Blocks
**Action**: Divide your day into blocks of 30-90 minutes

**Recommended block sizes**:
- **30-45 minutes**: Quick tasks, email, admin work
- **60-90 minutes**: Deep work, development, analysis
- **120+ minutes**: Complex projects, deep thinking

**Example Schedule**:
```
9:00-10:30am: Deep Work Block (MCP development)
10:30-10:45am: Break
10:45-11:30am: Communication Block (email, Slack)
11:30am-12:00pm: Admin Block (tickets, planning)
12:00-1:00pm: Lunch
1:00-2:30pm: Deep Work Block (continued development)
2:30-2:45pm: Break
2:45-3:30pm: Collaborative Block (code reviews, meetings)
3:30-4:30pm: Flexible Block (overflow, learning)
4:30-5:00pm: Planning Block (next day prep)
```

---

#### Step 4: Schedule Breaks
**Action**: Include 5-10 minute breaks between blocks

**Why it matters**: Breaks significantly increase productivity (from article)

**Break Activities**:
- Walk around
- Stretch
- Get water/coffee
- Step outside
- Eyes off screen

**Don't**: Check email, social media, "quick tasks" (they're never quick)

---

#### Step 5: Minimize Interruptions
**Action**: Protect your time blocks from disruptions

**Strategies** (from article):

##### Set Boundaries
- Use "do not disturb" sign/status
- Close door if you have one
- Wear headphones (even if not listening to music)

##### Designate Communication Times
- Check email only during communication blocks
- Batch Slack responses
- Set expectations with team: "I respond between X and Y times"

##### Use Technology Wisely
**Tools mentioned**: Toggl, Asana

**Additional tools**:
- Focus apps (Freedom, Cold Turkey)
- Calendar blocking (show as "busy")
- Phone on Do Not Disturb

---

### Managing Interruptions

**From the article**: "Even when you're committed to time blocking, interruptions are unavoidable."

#### Strategy 1: Set Boundaries
**How**: Use visual signals that you're unavailable

**Examples**:
- "Do not disturb" sign
- Slack status: "Deep work until 2pm"
- Calendar blocked as "Focus time"

---

#### Strategy 2: Designate Specific Times for Communication
**How**: Allocate specific times to check emails and messages

**Example**:
```
Communication windows:
- 10:45-11:30am
- 2:45-3:30pm
- 4:30-5:00pm

Outside these windows: Async only
```

**Benefit**: Prevents constant context-switching

---

#### Strategy 3: Use Technology Wisely
**Tools**: Toggl (time tracking), Asana (task management)

**How they help**:
- **Toggl**: Track actual time spent, identify where time goes
- **Asana**: Organize tasks, see priorities clearly

---
