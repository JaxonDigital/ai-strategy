## Executive Summary

**n8n-mcp** is an open-source MCP server that bridges AI assistants with n8n's workflow automation ecosystem. It provides AI agents with structured access to 536 n8n nodes, 2,500+ workflow templates, and comprehensive node documentation.

**Strategic Value**: This project demonstrates how to give AI agents the ability to BUILD and UNDERSTAND n8n workflows programmatically - a critical capability for our hybrid agent approach.

**Key Insight**: "Before MCP, I was translating. Now I'm composing." - Claude on n8n-mcp

---

## What is n8n-mcp?

### Purpose
An MCP server that exposes n8n's workflow automation capabilities to AI assistants through a structured protocol.

### Coverage
- **536 n8n nodes** (99% property coverage, 63.6% operation coverage)
- **2,646 pre-extracted workflow configurations**
- **2,500+ workflow template library**
- **263 AI-capable nodes** specifically identified
- **90% documentation coverage**

### Key Difference vs. Direct n8n API
| Approach | What it gives AI |
|----------|------------------|
| **Direct n8n API** | "Here's an API, figure it out" |
| **n8n-mcp** | "Here's structured knowledge about every node, with examples and validation" |

The MCP approach provides **semantic understanding**, not just raw API access.

---

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
```javascript
{
  "core": ["n8n", "n8n-workflow", "n8n-core"],
  "mcp": ["@modelcontextprotocol/sdk"],
  "database": ["better-sqlite3", "sql.js"],
  "ai": ["@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain", "openai"],
  "validation": ["zod"]
}
```

### Code Structure
```
src/
├── mcp/                 # MCP protocol implementation
│   └── tools.ts         # 14+ MCP tools for node operations
├── n8n/                 # n8n-specific logic
├── database/            # Pre-built node database (SQLite)
├── templates/           # 2,500+ workflow templates
├── services/            # Business logic layer
├── parsers/             # Node documentation parsers
├── mappers/             # Data transformation
└── utils/               # Helper functions
```

### How It Works
```
AI Assistant (Claude, GPT, etc)
    ↓
MCP Protocol (stdio communication)
    ↓
n8n-mcp Server
    ↓
Pre-built Node Database (SQLite)
    +
n8n API (optional, for workflow management)
    ↓
Structured Node Information + Validation
```

**Key Architecture Principle**: Pre-extract and structure node information rather than querying n8n API on-demand.

**Benefit**: Fast, consistent, AI-friendly responses without hammering n8n API.

---

## MCP Tools Provided

### 1. Node Discovery
```typescript
list_nodes(package?, category?, isAITool?, limit?)
  → Returns: List of available n8n nodes

search_nodes(query, limit?, mode?, includeExamples?)
  → Returns: Nodes matching search criteria

list_ai_tools()
  → Returns: 263 nodes optimized for AI workflows
```

**Use Case**: "Find all nodes that can send Slack messages"

---

### 2. Node Documentation
```typescript
get_node_info(nodeType)
  → Returns: Full node documentation, properties, operations

get_node_documentation(nodeType)
  → Returns: Human-readable docs

get_node_essentials(nodeType, includeExamples?)
  → Returns: Core info needed to use the node
```

**Use Case**: "How do I configure the Slack node to send a message?"

---

### 3. Property & Configuration Help
```typescript
search_node_properties(nodeType, query, maxResults?)
  → Returns: Specific properties matching search

get_property_dependencies(nodeType, config?)
  → Returns: Which properties affect which other properties
```

**Use Case**: "What fields are required when operation = 'sendMessage'?"

---

### 4. Validation
```typescript
validate_node_operation(nodeType, config, profile?)
  → Returns: Whether configuration is valid

validate_node_minimal(nodeType, config)
  → Returns: Whether required fields are present
```

**Use Case**: "Is this Slack node configuration valid before deployment?"

---

### 5. Templates & Examples
```typescript
list_tasks(category?)
  → Returns: Workflow templates by category

get_database_statistics()
  → Returns: Stats on available nodes and templates
```

**Use Case**: "Show me example workflows for Slack notifications"

---

### 6. Workflow Management (Optional)
Requires n8n API configuration:
```typescript
// Additional tools when n8n API is configured
- get_workflow(workflowId)
- list_workflows(active?, tags?)
- create_workflow(workflow)
- update_workflow(id, workflow)
- execute_workflow(id, input?)
```

---

## How This Relates to Our Hybrid Agent Approach

### Current Approach: n8n + AI
```
n8n Workflow (manually built)
    ↓
AI Node (Claude API call with context)
    ↓
MCPs (tools AI can use)
    ↓
Result
```

**Limitation**: Workflows are **manually designed** by humans.

---

### Enhanced Approach: AI Can Build Workflows
```
User Request: "Create a deployment health monitor"
    ↓
AI Agent (with n8n-mcp access)
    ↓
AI Searches Nodes: search_nodes("deployment health monitoring")
    ↓
AI Gets Node Info: get_node_info("n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest")
    ↓
AI Validates Config: validate_node_operation(...)
    ↓
AI Generates Workflow JSON
    ↓
n8n API: create_workflow(workflow)
    ↓
Workflow Created & Activated
```

**Benefit**: AI can now **design AND run** workflows, not just run pre-built ones.

---

---

## Technical Implementation for Jaxon Digital

### Option 1: Use n8n-mcp As-Is
**Approach**:
```bash
# Deploy n8n-mcp alongside our n8n instances
docker run -e N8N_API_URL=... -e N8N_API_KEY=... n8n-mcp

# Configure in Claude Code / MCP clients
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@n8n_io/n8n-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Pros**: Zero development, works immediately
**Cons**: Generic, not Optimizely-optimized

---

### Option 2: Fork & Customize
**Approach**:
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp.git jaxon-n8n-mcp

# Add custom nodes to database
src/database/custom-nodes/
  └── optimizely-cms.json
  └── optimizely-graph.json
  └── jaxon-deployment.json

# Add custom templates
src/templates/optimizely/
  └── deployment-health-monitor.json
  └── content-sync-workflow.json
  └── cache-invalidation.json

# Publish as @jaxondigital/n8n-mcp
npm publish
```

**Pros**: Differentiated, Optimizely-optimized
**Cons**: Maintenance overhead

**Recommendation**: Start with Option 1, move to Option 2 if we sell 3+ clients.

## Safety Considerations

### n8n-mcp Project Warnings
The project includes explicit safety warnings:

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTES**
> - Always make a copy of workflows before AI modifications
> - Test in development environments first
> - Export backups before changes
> - Validate all AI-generated configurations
> - Never give AI direct production access without approval gates

### Our Implementation Guardrails

**1. Approval Gates**
```javascript
if (workflow.isNew || workflow.hasChanges) {
  if (environment === 'production') {
    requireHumanApproval();
  }
}
```

**2. Sandbox Testing**
- All AI-generated workflows test in dev environment first
- Require successful execution before production deployment

**3. Backup Protocol**
- Auto-backup before any AI modification
- Keep 30-day history of all workflow versions

**4. Validation Layers**
```javascript
validate_node_minimal(config)      // Required fields present?
    ↓
validate_node_operation(config)    // Configuration valid?
    ↓
test_workflow(dev_environment)     // Actually works?
    ↓
human_approval()                    // Human confirms?
    ↓
deploy_to_production()
```
