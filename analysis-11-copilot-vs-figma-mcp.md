# Strategic Analysis: Copilot Vision vs Figma MCP

**Source**: Medium article by Youssef Taghlabi
**Date Analyzed**: 2025-10-08
**Relevance**: High - Design system automation and structured context

## Executive Summary

Comparison of GitHub Copilot Vision (screenshot-based design generation) vs Figma MCP (structured design data access). Key insight: MCP's structured approach (design-as-code) far superior to vision-based guessing for production applications. Strategic implications for our design-to-code services.

## Copilot Vision vs Figma MCP

| Approach | Copilot Vision | Figma MCP |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Method | Screenshot analysis | Structured API access |
| Accuracy | 60-70% | 95%+ |
| Design Tokens | Guesses | Exact values |
| Components | Recreates from scratch | Uses design system |
| Maintenance | Breaks on design changes | Syncs automatically |
| Production Ready | Rarely | Yes |

## Strategic Insights

**"Design-as-Code" Revolution**:
- MCP provides programmatic access to design files
- AI gets exact specs, not visual interpretation
- Maintains design system consistency
- Enables automated design-to-code pipelines

## Application to Jaxon Digital
