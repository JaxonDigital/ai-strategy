### 3. "How I Use CodeMCP for Development and Keep My Other Coding Assistants on Budget" by PowerUpSkills
**Ticket:** GAT-321
**PDF:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qYjBNjRJ4Qa06cF1-OYm87gILB5KM_HO/view?usp=sharing

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Addresses budget concerns (major client objection)
- Demonstrates ROI of specialized tools vs generic AI subscriptions
- Framework for justifying managed service costs

**KEY INSIGHTS:**
- Specialized tools reduce overall AI spend by targeting high-value tasks
- Generic AI subscriptions ($20-200/month/user) add up quickly
- Better to invest in domain-specific automation than broad AI access

**OBJECTION HANDLING:**

*Client:* "Why pay $40K for custom MCP when we can use ChatGPT for $20/month?"

*Response:* "Generic AI tools require constant supervision and manual corrections. Our custom MCPs automate complete workflows with zero errors. One deployment agent can save 20+ hours/month per developer—that's $50K+ in annual savings for a team of 5."

**PRICING JUSTIFICATION:**
- Show ROI calculator: custom MCP cost vs developer time saved
- Position managed service as "insurance" against AI tool sprawl
- Highlight reduction in generic AI subscriptions needed
