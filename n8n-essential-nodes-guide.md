## Executive Summary

**Key Insight**: "Master 80% of n8n by Learning Just These 17 Nodes"

The article identifies 17 core nodes that cover most automation use cases. For our hybrid agent approach (n8n + AI + MCPs), we can focus on a subset that directly supports our deployment monitoring, content workflows, and intelligent automation needs.

**Prioritization for Jaxon Digital**: 12 of these 17 nodes are critical for our hybrid agents, 3 are useful for specific cases, 2 are less relevant given we use MCPs.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Over-using Code Node
❌ **Bad**: Use Code Node for everything
```
Code Node: fetch data, transform, analyze, format
```

✅ **Good**: Use specific nodes where available
```
HTTP Request → IF → Code (only for custom logic) → HTTP Request
```

**Why**: Code nodes are harder to debug, less visual

---

### Mistake 2: Not Using Split Out/Aggregate
❌ **Bad**: Process arrays in Code Node
```javascript
const items = $json.items;
items.forEach(item => {
  // Process each item
});
```

✅ **Good**: Use Split Out
```
Split Out → Process individually → Aggregate
```

**Why**: Better parallelization, clearer flow

---

### Mistake 3: Complex IF Chains
❌ **Bad**: Nested IF nodes
```
IF → IF → IF → IF
```

✅ **Good**: Use Switch
```
Switch (4 cases)
```

**Why**: Easier to read, maintain

---

### Mistake 4: No Error Handling
❌ **Bad**: Assume APIs always work
```
HTTP Request → (fails silently)
```

✅ **Good**: Handle errors
```
HTTP Request
├─ Success → Continue
└─ Error → Log + Alert + Retry
```

**Why**: Production reliability

---

## Node Comparison: When to Use What

### Data Storage: Which Node?

| Use Case | Node | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Client-friendly dashboard | Google Sheets | Clients know Sheets |
| Structured relational data | Airtable | Better data model |
| Documentation/reports | Notion | Rich formatting |
| Workflow state/config | n8n Data Tables | No external dependency |

---

### Logic: IF vs Switch?

| Scenario | Use | Example |
|----------|-----|---------|
| 2 options | IF | errors > 10 → alert/log |
| 3+ options | Switch | status: deploying/success/failed/unknown |
| Complex conditions | Code + IF | Custom logic then route |

---

### Triggers: When to Use Each?

| Trigger Type | When to Use | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Schedule | Regular checks | Health monitor every 5 min |
| Webhook | External events | Azure DevOps deployment hook |
| App Trigger | Service events | GitHub PR created |
| Manual | Testing | Debug workflow logic |

---

## Integration with MCPs

### MCP Workflow Pattern

Instead of:
```
[HTTP Request: Optimizely API]
    ↓
[Code: Parse response]
    ↓
[Code: Handle auth]
```

With MCP:
```
[HTTP Request: Claude API with MCP access]
    ↓
Claude uses optimizely-dxp-mcp
    ↓
Structured response
```

**Key Nodes for MCP Integration**:
1. **HTTP Request** - Call Claude API
2. **Code Node** - Format MCP context
3. **Merge Node** - Combine MCP data sources
4. **Switch Node** - Route based on MCP results

---

## Cost Implications (n8n Cloud)

### Execution Counting

Each node execution counts toward limit:

**Example Workflow**:
```
Schedule → HTTP Request → IF → HTTP Request → Slack
```

**Executions per run**:
- Schedule: 1
- HTTP Request #1: 1
- IF: 1
- HTTP Request #2: 1 (if TRUE path)
- Slack: 1 (if TRUE path)

**Total**: 5 executions

**At 5-minute intervals**:
- Per hour: 12 runs × 5 executions = 60
- Per day: 60 × 24 = 1,440
- Per month: ~43,200 executions

**n8n Cloud Limits**:
- Starter ($20/month): 2,500 executions ❌ Not enough
- Pro ($50/month): 10,000 executions ❌ Not enough
- Advanced ($100/month): 50,000 executions ✅ Covers it

**Optimization**: Increase schedule interval to 15 min → 14,400/month (Pro tier works)

---

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Master 10 Critical Nodes
Focus on: Schedule, HTTP Request, IF, Switch, Code, Merge, Split Out, Aggregate, Webhooks, Manual Trigger

**These cover 90% of hybrid agent use cases**

---

### 2. HTTP Request is Your Swiss Army Knife
- Call any API
- Claude API integration
- MCP server access
- Custom services

**Most versatile node**

---

### 3. Code Node for Glue Logic
Don't overuse, but essential for:
- AI context formatting
- Complex parsing
- Custom calculations

**Use sparingly, but master it**

---

### 4. Split Out + Aggregate = Power Pattern
Process multiple items efficiently:
- Check multiple deployments
- Analyze multiple logs
- Validate multiple configs

**Learn this pattern early**

---

### 5. Watch Execution Limits on Cloud
Each node = 1 execution
Frequent schedules add up fast

**Optimize interval or upgrade tier**

---

## Conclusion

**The 17 essential nodes provide everything we need** for hybrid agents:

- **Triggers**: Schedule, Webhooks, App-specific
- **Logic**: IF, Switch, Code
- **Data**: HTTP Request, Merge, Split Out, Aggregate
- **Storage**: n8n Data Tables, Notion (for docs)

**Focus on mastering these 10-12 nodes** rather than learning all 1,250+ available nodes.

**For hybrid agents**: HTTP Request + Code + Logic nodes = 80% of what we need.

**Next Step**: Build team training around these core nodes.
