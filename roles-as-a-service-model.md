# Roles-as-a-Service Business Model

**Date**: October 5, 2025
**Strategic Insight**: Agents = Role Replacements, not just "automation"

---

## The Realization

**What You Already Have**:
- ✅ MCPs (tools for n8n workflows to use)
- ✅ n8n (orchestration platform = agent brain)
- ✅ Expertise in building workflows

**What You're Actually Building**:
- Not "automation tools"
- Not "AI infrastructure"
- **Roles-as-a-Service** - autonomous agents that replace specific job functions

---

## The Architecture (What You're Already Doing)

```
Role: "Deployment Health Manager"
         ↓
n8n Workflow (the "agent brain")
    ├─ Schedule: Check every 5 minutes
    ├─ Logic: If errors > threshold, alert
    ├─ Decision: Should we rollback?
    └─ Action: Execute via MCPs
         ↓
MCPs (the "agent's tools")
    ├─ DXP Operations MCP (check status, deploy, rollback)
    ├─ Log Analysis MCP (analyze errors)
    └─ Slack MCP (send alerts)
         ↓
Systems (where work happens)
    └─ Optimizely DXP, logs, etc.
```

**This IS an agent** - it's just implemented in n8n instead of custom code.

**Advantage**: n8n is visual, modifiable, maintainable - actually BETTER than custom agent code.

## Role Replacement Framework

### Traditional Hiring Model

**Client needs**: Someone to monitor deployments 24/7

**Traditional solution**: Hire a person
- Junior DevOps Engineer: $80-120K/year salary
- + Benefits: 30% = $24-36K
- + Recruiting: $15-25K
- + Training: 3-6 months ramp-up
- + Management overhead: 10-20 hours/month
- **Total Year 1**: ~$150K
- **Ongoing**: ~$130K/year

**Problems**:
- Single point of failure (person quits, sick, vacation)
- Human error (typos, missed alerts, tired at 3am)
- Limited hours (even on-call has response time)
- Hard to scale (need more people = linear cost)

### Roles-as-a-Service Model

**Client needs**: Someone to monitor deployments 24/7

**Your solution**: Deployment Health Agent
- Setup: Build n8n workflow + MCPs ($50K one-time)
- Monthly: Host, monitor, maintain ($8K/month)
- **Total Year 1**: $146K
- **Ongoing**: $96K/year

**Advantages**:
- 24/7/365 operation (never sleeps)
- Zero human error (consistent execution)
- Instant response (no reaction time)
- Scales infinitely (add more workflows, same platform)
- Never quits (no turnover)
- Improves over time (you refine workflows)

**When it makes sense**:
- Routine, repeatable work ✓
- 24/7 monitoring needed ✓
- Pattern-based decisions ✓
- Tool/system integration required ✓

**When it doesn't**:
- Strategic decisions ✗
- Creative work ✗
- Complex stakeholder management ✗
- Unprecedented situations ✗

---

## Revenue Projections: Roles-as-a-Service Model

### Conservative Scenario (Year 1)

**5 clients, average 2 agents each**:
- Setup fees: 5 clients × 2 agents × $55K avg = $550K
- Monthly fees: 5 clients × 2 agents × $9K avg × 12 = $540K
- **Year 1 Total: $1.09M**

**Year 2** (no new clients, just recurring):
- Monthly fees: $540K
- Upsells: 2 clients add 1 agent each × $55K + ($9K×6mo) = $218K
- **Year 2 Total: $758K**

### Aggressive Scenario (Year 1)

**10 clients, average 3 agents each**:
- Setup fees: 10 × 3 × $60K avg = $1.8M
- Monthly fees: 10 × 3 × $10K avg × 12 = $3.6M
- **Year 1 Total: $5.4M**

**Year 2**:
- Monthly fees: $3.6M
- 5 new clients × 3 agents: $900K setup + $1.8M recurring (6mo) = $2.7M
- **Year 2 Total: $6.3M**

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Positioning

**Don't say**: "We build AI automation and MCPs"
**Do say**: "We provide specialized roles as managed services - you get 24/7 operational coverage without hiring"

**Don't say**: "n8n workflows and Model Context Protocol integrations"
**Do say**: "Think of it like hiring a Deployment Health Manager who works 24/7, never quits, and costs 30% less"

### Sales Conversation

**Discovery Questions**:
1. "What routine operational tasks consume your team's time?"
2. "Which roles are hard to hire/retain right now?"
3. "What processes need 24/7 coverage but you can't justify full-time staff?"
4. "Where do human errors cause the most pain?"

**Qualification**:
- Budget: Can they afford $40-60K setup + $8-12K/month?
- Pain: Is the role actually painful/expensive?
- Systems: Do they have systems we can integrate with?
- Culture: Are they open to automation replacing routine work?

**Objection Handling**:

*"This seems expensive"*
→ "Compared to hiring a person at $120K/year who works 40 hours/week, this is 30% less and works 168 hours/week. Plus no recruiting fees, no benefits, no turnover risk."

*"What if it breaks?"*
→ "That's what the monthly management fee covers - we monitor it 24/7, fix issues, and continuously improve it. You get an SLA guaranteeing uptime."

*"Will this replace our team?"*
→ "No - it replaces the routine, repetitive parts of their jobs so they can focus on strategic work. Your DevOps team stops monitoring dashboards at 2am and starts building better architecture."

*"How do we know it'll work?"*
→ "We start with a pilot - one role, 90 days, prove the value. If it doesn't save time and reduce errors, we refund the setup fee."

## Service Delivery Model

### Phase 1: Discovery & Role Definition (Week 1-2)
- Workshop: Understand current role responsibilities
- Documentation: What does this person do daily/weekly/monthly?
- Prioritization: Which tasks can be automated?
- Success metrics: How do we measure the agent's performance?
- **Deliverable**: Role specification document

### Phase 2: Design & Architecture (Week 3-4)
- Workflow design: Map out n8n workflow logic
- MCP identification: What MCPs needed? (existing or custom)
- Integration points: What systems to connect?
- Approval workflows: Where does human stay in loop?
- **Deliverable**: Technical architecture document + workflow mockups

### Phase 3: Build (Week 5-8)
- Build/customize MCPs
- Build n8n workflows
- Test in staging environment
- Refine based on edge cases
- **Deliverable**: Working agent in staging

### Phase 4: Pilot (Week 9-12)
- Deploy to production (limited scope)
- Run parallel with human (validate accuracy)
- Monitor performance
- Refine based on real-world behavior
- **Deliverable**: Production agent + performance report

### Phase 5: Handoff & Ongoing Management
- Training: Show client how to monitor/override
- Documentation: Runbooks, troubleshooting
- Monitoring: You watch it 24/7
- Monthly: Performance reports + continuous improvement
- **Deliverable**: Managed service SLA

---

## Why This Model Works

### 1. Clear Value Proposition
- Not selling "technology" (abstract)
- Selling "roles" (concrete)
- Clients understand what they're buying
- Easy to calculate ROI (vs. hiring)

### 2. Recurring Revenue
- Monthly management fees create predictability
- Clients don't churn (agent is critical infrastructure)
- Multiple agents per client = expansion revenue
- Recurring = higher company valuation

### 3. Leverage Existing Work
- You're already building this (n8n workflows)
- MCPs you've built become reusable tools
- Patterns repeat across clients (economies of scale)

### 4. Competitive Moat
- Hard to replicate (requires MCP expertise + n8n + AI + domain knowledge)
- High switching costs (replacing operational role is risky)
- Network effects (more agents = more MCP library = faster delivery)

### 5. Scalable Delivery
- Agent templates become reusable
- MCP library grows over time
- Faster delivery = more clients = lower cost per agent
- Platform infrastructure amortized across clients

## The Strategic Insight

**You don't need to build custom "agents" from scratch.**

**You already have the architecture**:
- n8n = Agent orchestration platform ✓
- MCPs = Tools agents use ✓
- Expertise = Building workflows ✓

**You just needed the business model**:
- **Roles-as-a-Service**
- Price based on role value, not technology complexity
- Monthly recurring revenue, not one-time projects
- Managed service, not hand-off-and-forget

**This is the bridge** from:
- "MCP consultant" (project-based, $100-400K/year)
- To "Agent service provider" (recurring, $1-5M+/year)

The technology you're building in n8n **IS** the agent layer. You just need to sell it as "roles" not "workflows."
