# Hybrid Agents - Action Plan

**Date**: October 5, 2025
**Status**: Currently testing n8n + AI hybrid approach
**Goal**: Validate and scale intelligent agent tier

---

## Current State

**What we're building**:
```
n8n workflow (routine automation)
    +
AI node (Claude/GPT for intelligence)
    +
MCPs (tools AI can use)
    =
Hybrid intelligent agent
```

**We're testing this NOW** - ahead of the market.

---

## 5 Critical Focus Areas

### 1. Measure Cost vs. Value

**Track every hybrid workflow**:
- AI API cost: $X per investigation
- Time saved: Y minutes per incident
- Value: Y min × $150/hr = $Z saved
- ROI: $Z / $X = ROI ratio

**Target**: 5x+ ROI (spend $1 on AI, save $5 in time)

**Example**:
```
Deployment investigation:
- AI cost: $0.02
- Time saved: 20 minutes
- Value: 20 min × $2.50/min = $50
- ROI: 2,500x

Can charge $4K/month premium easily.
```

---

### 2. Test Accuracy Relentlessly

**After every AI investigation, validate**:
- Was the root cause correct? (yes/no)
- Was the recommendation useful? (1-5 scale)
- Did the engineer act on it? (yes/no)

**Track accuracy rate**:
- Week 1: Maybe 60-70% (initial prompts)
- Week 2: Improve to 75-80% (tune prompts)
- Week 3: Target 85%+ (production ready)

**If stuck below 80%**:
- Give AI more context (more MCP access)
- Be more specific in prompts
- Add validation steps

---

### 3. Identify Which Workflows Win

**Not all workflows benefit equally from AI.**

**High AI value** (test these first):
- ✅ Deployment troubleshooting
- ✅ Security event analysis
- ✅ Performance degradation investigation
- ✅ Error pattern detection

**Low AI value** (stick with pure n8n):
- ❌ Scheduled publishing
- ❌ Data synchronization
- ❌ Simple threshold alerts
- ❌ Report generation

**Find the 3-5 workflows where AI creates 10x+ value.**

---

### 4. Price It Like a Role, Not Technology

**Don't say**: "We added AI to your workflow (+$4K/month for Claude API)"

**Do say**: "We upgraded from monitoring to investigation - your agent now acts like a senior engineer, explaining WHY failures happen and HOW to fix them (+$4K/month)"

**Pricing anchors**:
- Basic tier = "Junior engineer monitoring" = $8-10K/month
- Intelligent tier = "Senior engineer investigating" = $12-15K/month (+50%)
- Premium tier = "Principal engineer deciding" = $20-25K/month (+150%)

**Client thinks**: "I'm paying for expertise, not technology"

---

### 5. Get 1 Paid Pilot ASAP

**Pick your best client**, offer them:

"We've added AI investigation to your deployment monitoring. For the next 4 weeks, try it free. If you see value, it's +$4K/month after that."

**Measure during pilot**:
- Do they actually use the AI analysis?
- Do they act on recommendations?
- Do they say it's valuable?
- Will they pay for it after pilot?

**If yes to 3+**: You have product-market fit. Scale it.

**If no**: Diagnose why, iterate, test again.

- Deterministic logic
- Automated action execution
- Fast, reliable, predictable

**Example**: Deployment Health Monitor
- Checks status every 5 min
- Alerts when errors > threshold
- Creates ticket
- Executes approved rollback

---

### Intelligent Tier (n8n + AI)

## Strategic Evolution

**The path we're on**:

```
2024: "We build MCPs"
    ↓
2025 Q4: "We build workflow agents (n8n)"
    ↓
2026 Q1: "We build INTELLIGENT agents (n8n + AI)" ← WE'RE HERE
    ↓
2026+: "We provide operational roles-as-a-service"
```

**The hybrid approach** (n8n + AI) is the sweet spot:
- Cost-effective (n8n for routine, AI only when needed)
- Intelligent (AI reasoning when it matters)
- Reliable (deterministic workflows + smart analysis)
- Scalable (templates + MCP library)
- Profitable (charge premium for intelligence)

## Revenue Projection

### Year 1 (Conservative)

**5 clients, intelligent tier**:
- Setup fees: 5 × $70K = $350K
- Monthly fees: 5 × $12K × 12 = $720K
- **Total Year 1**: $1.07M

### Year 2 (Growth)

**10 clients total** (5 existing + 5 new):
- New setup fees: 5 × $70K = $350K
- Monthly fees: 10 × $12K × 12 = $1.44M
- **Total Year 2**: $1.79M

### Year 3 (Scale)

**20 clients total**:
- New setup fees: 10 × $70K = $700K
- Monthly fees: 20 × $12K × 12 = $2.88M
- **Total Year 3**: $3.58M

**This is 10x+ what you'd make selling MCPs as one-time projects.**

## Why This Matters

**Most competitors** are still stuck on:
- "We build automations"
- One-time project revenue
- Commoditized services

**You're building**:
- "We provide intelligent operational roles"
- Recurring revenue model
- Premium differentiated service

**The hybrid approach is your competitive moat**:
- Combines cost efficiency (n8n) with intelligence (AI)
- Practical for real businesses (not over-engineered)
- Delivers tangible ROI (time savings, faster resolution)
- Scales efficiently (templates + MCP library)

## Immediate Next Steps

### This Week:
1. **Measure everything**: Set up tracking for cost, accuracy, speed, value
2. **Document results**: What's working? What's not?
3. **Get feedback**: Show to 1-2 trusted contacts, ask "would you pay for this?"

### Next Week:
4. **Iterate**: Fix what's not working
5. **Calculate ROI**: Real numbers - cost vs. value
6. **Decision point**: Is this ready for paid pilot?

### Month 2:
7. **Pilot client**: 1 paid engagement
8. **Validate pricing**: Will they pay the premium?
9. **Build case study**: Document results

### Month 3:
10. **Productize**: Create repeatable service
11. **Launch**: Offer to broader market
12. **Scale**: Target 3-5 clients

## The Bottom Line

**You're testing exactly the right thing.**

The hybrid model (n8n + AI) is:
- ✅ Practical (works in production)
- ✅ Profitable (premium pricing justified)
- ✅ Scalable (templates reduce delivery time)
- ✅ Defensible (hard for competitors to replicate)

**Now it's about execution**:
1. Measure relentlessly
2. Validate with paying clients
3. Productize the winners
4. Scale through repeatability

**You're ahead of the market.** Most consultants haven't figured this out yet.

This is your path from $200K project business to $1M+ recurring revenue business.
