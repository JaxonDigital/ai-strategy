1. Build Failure Prediction & Intelligent Diagnostics (High Value)

  Where: After build failures in the Build stage
  Value:
  - Analyze build logs and suggest specific fixes ("EPiServer.CloudPlatform.Cms.dll missing â†’ Add CopyRefAssembliesToPublishDirectory=true")
  - Learn from the history of builds 3291-3305 to predict which changes are likely to cause failures
  - Auto-detect when NuGet cache is stale and needs refresh

  Implementation: Add a post-build step that sends logs to an AI agent that returns actionable recommendations

  2. Deployment Risk Assessment (High Value)

  Where: Between Build and Deploy stages
  Value:
  - Analyze git diff of changes and predict deployment risk score
  - Compare current package to successful deployments in history
  - Recommend: "This deployment touches authentication code - high risk, suggest extra validation"
  - Flag deployments that modify critical files (EPiServer configs, web.config, etc.)

  Implementation: Gate deployment stage based on AI risk analysis

  3. Performance Anomaly Detection (Medium-High Value)

  Where: During and after DXP deployment
  Value:
  - Monitor deployment duration (currently 9.4 min) and alert if significantly longer
  - Analyze Application Insights logs post-deployment for error rate spikes
  - Auto-detect "deployment succeeded but site performance degraded 30%"
  - Compare frontend bundle sizes across deployments

  Implementation: Post-deployment validation task with AI-powered log analysis

  4. Smart Test Selection (Medium Value)

  Where: After .NET build, before publish
  Value:
  - If you add automated tests, AI predicts which tests are likely to fail based on code changes
  - Run high-risk tests first for faster feedback
  - Skip tests unrelated to changes (e.g., frontend v1 tests when only v2 changed)

  Implementation: AI-powered test runner that analyzes git diff

  5. Dependency Vulnerability & Upgrade Advisor (Medium Value)

  Where: During NuGet restore
  Value:
  - Real-time scanning of package vulnerabilities beyond standard tooling
  - Suggest safe upgrade paths: "EPiServer.CMS 12.x.x has breaking changes affecting your ContentArea usage"
  - Predict compatibility issues before upgrading

  Implementation: Pre-restore analysis step with AI package advisor

  6. Frontend Bundle Optimization (Lower Value, but interesting)

  Where: After frontend builds
  Value:
  - Analyze webpack bundles and suggest code-splitting opportunities
  - Detect unused dependencies in package.json
  - Recommend tree-shaking improvements

  Most Practical Starting Point:

  I'd recommend #2 (Deployment Risk Assessment) because:
  1. You're already experiencing the pain (builds 3294-3302 all failed)
  2. Direct API deployment gives you full control to add gates
  3. Could prevent bad deployments before they reach DXP
  4. Low implementation cost - just add a validation step before deployment

  Example Implementation:
  # After package creation, before deployment
  - task: PowerShell@2
    displayName: 'AI Deployment Risk Analysis'
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: |
        # Send git diff + package metadata to AI
        $risk = Invoke-AIRiskAnalysis -Changes "$(git diff origin/integration...HEAD)"

        if ($risk.score -gt 7) {
          Write-Warning "High risk deployment detected: $($risk.reasons)"
          # Could fail here or just warn
        }
